# Laravel RESTful Filter
A simple way to filter your query on RESTful API

# Compatibility
| Framework      | Version                    |
| :------------- | :----------:               |
| Laravel        | `5.*`, `6.*`, `7.*`, `8.*` |
| Lumen          | `5.*`, `6.*`, `7.*`, `8.*` |

# Limitation
- Currently, only working on SQL type Database (already tested on MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server)
- Probably SQL query not optimized (already checked on this but i think it doesn't have, the result was fast. In the end, it's your choise)
- Sorting through relation not available
- Filter `Between` and `In` not available
- Can't add custom logic

# Available Search Operators
 - Less Than
 - Less Than Equal
 - Greater Than
 - Greater Than Equal
 - Equal
 - LIKE
 - NOT

# Installation
Install from composer
```bash
composer install kemodev/laravel-restful-filter
```
Use Package on your Model
```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Kemodev\RestfulFilter\Filterable;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class User extends Model
{
    use Filterable;

    //rest of your code on model
}
```

# Get Started
First, you need to define what field that able to filter with your API
## 1. Filter
There are 3 kind available method for filter:
 - Basic
```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Kemodev\RestfulFilter\Filterable;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class User extends Model
{
    use Filterable;

    protected $filterableColumns = [
        'email' => 'email'
    ];
    //rest of your code on model
}
```
 - Relation
 ```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Kemodev\RestfulFilter\Filterable;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class User extends Model
{
    use Filterable;

    protected $filterableColumns = [
        'email' => 'email',
        'role_name' => 'role.name'
    ];

    public function role()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Role::class);
    }
    //rest of your code on model
}
```
 - All of Kind
 ```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Kemodev\RestfulFilter\Filterable;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class User extends Model
{
    use Filterable;

    protected $filterableColumns = [
        'email' => 'email',
        'search' => 'first_name,last_name,role.name'
    ];

    public function role()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Role::class);
    }
    //rest of your code on model
}
```
This method usually used when using one field filter like on default [datatables](https://datatables.net)

## 2. Sorting
```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Kemodev\RestfulFilter\Filterable;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class User extends Model
{
    use Filterable;

    protected $sortableColumns = [
        'email' => 'email'
    ];

    //rest of your code on model
}
```

**If you notice, that variables was associate array with key indicate the query param on URL and value was the column name.**

## 3. Usage
The most basic one, you can use like these
```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Users;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class UserController extends Controller
{
    public function getAll(Request $request)
    {
        $filter = $request->except('sort');
        $sort = $request->get('sort');

        $data = User::searchable($filter)
            ->sortable($sort)
            ->get();
    }
}
```
with this code, it will assume that you produce url like <br>
[https://your-domain.dev?name=febryan&email=febryan@example.com&sort=name_asc](https://your-domain.dev?name=febryan&email=febryan@example.com&sort=name_asc)

But the `$filter` variables take scope to wide, because you may have another query params that not related for filter your data. The best practice that i assume was write your code like these

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Users;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class UserController extends Controller
{
    public function getAll(Request $request)
    {
        $filter = $request->get('filters');
        $sort = $request->get('sort');

        $data = User::searchable($filter)
            ->sortable($sort)
            ->get();
    }
}
```
with this code, it will assume that you produce url like <br>
[https://your-domain.dev?filters[name]=febryan&filters[email]=febryan@example.com&sort=name_asc&signature=123qweasdzxc](https://your-domain.dev?filters[name]=febryan&filters[email]=febryan@example.com&sort=name_asc&signature=123qweasdzxc)

For using available search operator on filter, you can input your query params like these:
- Less Than: `filters[age]=lt:12`
- Less Than Equal: `filters[age]=lte:12`
- Greater Than: `filters[age]=gt:12`
- Greater Than Equal: `filters[age]=gte:12`
- Equal: `filters[name]=John Doe`
- LIKE: `filters[name]=like:john`
- NOT: `filters[name]=not:John Doe`

For change direction on sorting, you can input your query params like these:
- Ascending: `sort=name_asc`
- Descending: `sort=name_desc`

Or you want declare multiple sorting, just type your query params like these:
`sort=name_asc,email_desc`
